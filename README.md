Hello, the purpose of my application, which I made with Kotlin, is to access various information on subjects with different features. You can read information on any subject you want, add it to your favorites, and search for the data you want. If you wish, you can download my application from play store -> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.canyldz.careertree

# Used API

# To Inform
Some files in this project (google json, gemini api, etc.) have been removed due to private information. In short, when you want to download and run this application, it will give an error and will not work. But you can examine the codes without any problems.
